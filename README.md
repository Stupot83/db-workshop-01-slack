# Databases Workshop 1: Querying Slack

Work in pairs. Start by forking this repo, and making sure you both have access
to the fork. Clone the repo to one of your laptops. Pair on this in driver
navigator style, but swap around for each task.

For each task below, find a **single sql query** that returns the correct
result. Add it do this document in the ` ```sql ``` ` blocks, plus any notes.
Make sure your changes are commited and pushed when you finish.

# Tasks:

## 1: Get the name of every channel created by user id 2

```sql
-- your SQL goes in here
```

## 2: Get the 5 most recent messages in channel id 5

```sql

```

## 3: Get the first 10 messages posted in channel id 11

```sql

```

## 4: Get the names and emails of every admin user

```sql

```

## 5: Get the name of every user who isn't an admin or a bot

```sql

```

## 6: Get all the messages posted in the channel with name 'resources'

> **Remember:** You need to write this as a _single sql query_ - you can't look
> up the channel ID manually first.

```sql

```

## 7: Get the names of every user in channel 'sd-cohort3-may18'

```sql

```

## 8: Get the name of every channel that you belong to

Use your email address as part of your `WHERE` - don't query by your user id.

```sql

```

## 9: Get the total number of messages created

```sql

```

## 10: Create a query that returns the text of each message, the name of the channel it was posted in, and the name of the poster, in chronological order

hint: there should be the same number of results as there are messages - use
this to manually check the results you're getting!

```sql

```

## 11: Find names of the 5 users who have sent the most messages

```sql

```

## 12: Find the names of every user who has never sent a message

```sql

```
